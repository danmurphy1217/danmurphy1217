## Hi there, I'm Dan.ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Economics major at Davidson College, Lead Engineer at [**Jam**](https://www.joinjam.io/), Consultant at [**Wilbur Labs**](https://www.wilburlabs.com/), Software Engineer at [**Stacauto**](https://www.stacauto.com/), and LXD Data Team intern at [**Pathstream**](https://www.pathstream.com/). Most of my professional projects are written in Ruby and Python, and most of my personal ones are written in Python (more coming this winterðŸ˜„).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building public and internally-facing APIs with Django and Flask, live backend pipelines with Ruby and various APIs, and data-driven interfaces with JS, R, Python, and Ruby.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about AWS (lambda, ec2, S3, RDS, and more), various forms of user authentication (session storage vs. JWT), Google Cloud, Python design patterns, and how to build CLI's in Ruby and Python.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I started coding, my recent professional projects, and what I plan to work on next.
